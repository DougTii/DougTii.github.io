                            SIGCSE should prioritize social and ethical issues in computer science education, 
                            provide training and resources for educators and researchers, 
                            increase diversity and inclusivity in programming and attendees,

                        The SIGCSE (Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) conference and 
                        community are problematic in their lack of attention to issues of equity, diversity, 
                        and inclusion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference programming and community largely exclude voices and perspectives from 
                        underrepresented groups in computing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lack of diversity and inclusivity in the conference perpetuates systemic issues in 
                        the field of computer science education and research.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The field of computer science education and research must address issues of social and 
                        ethical concern, including systemic bias and discrimination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference and community must prioritize issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion 
                        in their programming and overall focus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference must provide resources and training for educators and researchers to 
                        address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion in their work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference must work actively to increase diversity and inclusivity in its programming 
                        and attendees.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference must foster a sense of community among attendees, particularly among 
                        underrepresented groups, to provide support and resources for their work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference must hold itself accountable for making progress on issues of equity, 
                        diversity, and inclusion, setting concrete goals and regularly reporting on progress 
                        towards those goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference should dedicate more resources and programming to social and ethical 
                        issues in computer science education, including keynote speakers, panel discussions, 
                        and workshops.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference should provide workshops on designing inclusive curriculum and pedagogy, 
                        as well as resources for addressing bias in algorithms and machine learning systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference should provide travel grants and scholarships for underrepresented groups, 
                        as well as actively recruit diverse speakers and presenters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference should provide networking events and mentorship programs that connect individuals 
                        from diverse backgrounds and provide support and resources for their work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The broader field of computer science education and research must also prioritize issues of equity, 
                        diversity, and inclusion, and work to address systemic issues in the field.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Addressing issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion in computer science education and research 
                        is essential for creating a more just and equitable society, as computing technologies increasingly 
                        shape our world.
