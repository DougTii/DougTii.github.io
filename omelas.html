            <strong>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas questions individualism, happiness and suffering, and coming of age in society. </strong>
            The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas starts by introducing the Festival of Summer in the city of Omelas by the sea, picturing the city as almost utopian but most importantly everyone in the city is happy. 
            In the city of Omelas, all of its inhabitants live in complete happiness because they understand what is necessary and what is destructive. 
            The author asks the reader to imagine Omelas as a city where citizens have what is necessary and unnecessary but non-destructive, for example, they might have access to “central heating, subway trains, washing machines, a cure for the common cold. 
            Or they could have none of that; it doesn't matter” so long as what is in the city is not destructive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The author then asks us “Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy?” and introduces a secret of Omelas.
            In a dark and windowless room about the size of a room closet beneath the city, lives a single malnourished child, who the author refers to as ‘it’.
            Due to the child’s situation, “It has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect” the child only receives visitors only when the child’s water and food need to be refilled.
            However, the child has not always lived in the dark basement, the child remembers “sunlight and its mother’s voice.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The child’s existence is not a secret to the inhabitants of Omelas, furthermore, everyone in the city understands that the happiness and perfection in Omelas is dependent on the child’s suffering. 
            Learning about the child’s existence is the coming of age ritual in Omelas, during the Festival of Summer, each child learns about the existence of the child. The children are initially disgusted and angry about the mistreatment of the child however most soon accept the misery of the child as reality and a necessary evil.
            The people of Omelas do not forget about the existence of the child, understanding the child’s suffering allows the citizens to further appreciate their own happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although most of the children are able to come to terms with the suffering of the child, some reject the terms of life in Omelas and they choose to leave the city alone and in complete science.
            The author does not tell us where those who walk away from Omelas go, but we are told that they walk away with a sense of purpose, seeming to know where they are going.
